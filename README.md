## 🌱 How to start this project?

Under the guidance of your mentor, you will form your project team. **Ideally, they should be teams of 3 people**, looking for motivation for the project to be carried out and the ability to collaborate. 

If you are working solo (strongly not recommended), it is advisable to look in online communities for other people who are aligned with learning and improving their programming skills like you and who are willing to team up and do this type of project.

The goal is for teams to successfully reach the end of the project, combining **interest in the project** and **ability to develop interesting features** in the best possible way.

> 🔥 It is great to work on convincing your classmates to join your project, but, keep in mind that you will dramatically learn more by working with someone else (in a group); even if you are not building your own idea, all members must compromise on some ideas to achieve the best for the team.

## Project Scope

One key to project success is correctly defining and delimiting projects according to the available time, the expected dedication, and the team's capabilities.

> 💡 In real life, 70% of coding projects fail because of bad requirements. If the project's scope is not well defined, the team will perceive the failure to achieve the objective negatively, generating frustration and disillusionment.

### ☑️ A successful final project must include

- Good design and aesthetic presentation: we are not dedicated to design, but we must have criteria about what looks good and what does not, what is well aligned and built, or not, and for this, looking for references in other websites is essential.

- Registration, authentication and password reset.
  - [The password must be encrypted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-hashing-with-bcrypt-in-flask/), not in plain text, for security.

- A backend with a custom API to perform the transactions of your project.

- Have at least 3 more content views and an entire CRUD. For example:

  - Blog: Home, listing, article with comments....

  - E-commerce: Home, item listing, shopping cart, item detail...

- Integrate with one or more third party APIs, as well as leverage other libraries to improve the quality of the project and optimize development time.

- Be [deployed in production](<https://4geeks.com/docs/start/deploy-to-render-com>).

## 📝Instructions

1. Create a project in [Github Project](https://docs.github.com/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) and add your teammates. This is where the user stories of your product backlog should be. When all team members agree on the content of the stories and the scope of the project.
  
2. Write the user stories of the product backlog of your final project. Remember that this list of user stories corresponds to the general features of the project, which will later be specified as tasks throughout the scrums.
